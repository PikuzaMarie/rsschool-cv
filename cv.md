## About me
Having started as a UI/UX Designer, I realised that my strong analytical skills and patience can help me to succeed in code area too. My aim is to work hard and dedicate as much time as possible to reach the position of a Frontend developer at some project. I consider myself a creative person who values logic in their work which fits great in programming sphere.

I blast at:
* making neat and readable work files
* working for quality
* independent learning and self-development
* time management

I'm looking for a job where I can become a valuable team member who will help to make pleasing website or application.
